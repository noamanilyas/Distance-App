# Coding Exercise

Our CEO, Mark, would like to reach out to our partners with offices within a given range of Cafe Central London (51.5144636,-0.142571), to invite them for a business meal on Monday at noon.

Your help is much appreciated here, as we need to have an intuitive UI that calls an API to show the contact details of those partners, within a given range (in kilometers).

Youâ€™re expected to build your solution using Typescript, NodeJS, and React.

Your API should read the list of partners (from the attached SAMPLE_JSON file), and return the company names and addresses of the matching partners (with offices within the given range in kilometers) sorted by company name in ascending order.

Make sure to use the formula in the supporting materials to calculate the distance. And don't forget to convert degrees to radians!

Details matter. The Code should be well-architected, structured, designed, fully tested, and ready to be shipped to production. Moreover, the solution should be scalable allowing more features to be added in the future.
